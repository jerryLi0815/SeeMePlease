It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

No alternative text. So basically there's no description on any of the image there, which sucks because it's pretty important, I guess, that you know what the image is. I think not sure what it is. Okay. Okay. Look, it's great, because there's, you know, there's a great description above with the actual post itself, but it's not describing what's in the actual image, which is, you know, it's really important that there is one. Particularly with media like LinkedIn where it's something like this is it's heavily important that I guess all the image is one of the main things that's post. So it's it's really important that everybody gets that information. So it's really important that everybody gets that information. So it's really important that everybody gets that information. So it's really important that everybody gets that information. It's not about where we're purple day, that's cool. But there's no alt text. I don't want to be like a broken record, but alt text is really important. Doesn't need to be huge thing. It's just a little description of what's in the image and then everybody's got the same information, which is really important to make everybody feel included. Alrighty. Thank you. Yeah. Just going to try and look through this. And now for page one. Okay. Okay. I'm going to slow that down so you can hear what that says. I don't even know what it's what it's trying to say. What does that even mean? I think it's reading at this heading. But that is it's like it's reading out maybe what the coding is on the bite. I don't understand. I know PDF is a nightmare with screen readers. That's it's pretty much all I have to say. I can access the information sometimes, but it reads out hundreds of things that aren't even there and it doesn't read out anything correctly a lot of the time. I'm going to slow that down right down and just this is what I'm hearing. Procity equals caught. What does that even mean? That's bizarre. It just said the same thing again. You're currently on a text element. It's yeah. It's not even reading any of the text on the screen. PDFs I think they can be done to be accessible, but more often than not PDFs are just a nightmare when it comes to a screen reader. And not even just a screen reader if you're using magnification and things like that, they can just be a bit tough to navigate. But you know, a lot of the exact tough, but it can be done a lot better and a lot easier. Okay, now let's just give it up on me. It's just keeps on reading that same thing open over again. I don't even know what it means. I'd say whatever the coding is or whatever that is that's under the headings under the text. It's actually providing the PDF image is just it's reading that part of it and not what's actually on the image. So I guess if it's a PDF if there's maybe like an alt text to a text box that actually has what it says or something like that. There's ways of fixing it, but it's just a matter of labeling it and whatnot. Alrighty, well hopefully this was helpful. Thank you.\n"
